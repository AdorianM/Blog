# Future Camel

## Meet the team

Our team is made up of 3 passionate people who want to make games.

I'm Adorian and I am currently working as a Full Stack Engineer. However, I always wanted to make video game.
I have a shamefully large collection of games on Steam ðŸ˜… and I've been playing video games since I was 6 years old.
I've been extremely lucky to be able to experience such beautiful memories and it's all thanks to the brilliant game developers who put a lot of hard work into making them.
It is time that I also give back. I want to also make games which will hopefully make others happy as I have been made happy before.

## How it all started

Future Camel was a bit of a surprise for all of us. Me and Daniel joined the [14th Pirate Software Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/pirate) and we started working on what was to become [Vampire Solitaire](https://olddews.itch.io/vampire-solitaire). This was proof enough for us that we can and we enjoy doing this. We decided that the best next step would be to release Vampire Solitaire on Steam and move forward towards more ambitious projects.

## What's next?

We have a lot of cool ideas that we would love to share with you, so we created this website as the central point of news regarding the Future Camel project. Here you'll see new games being released by us, sneak peeks, devlogs, development guides and anything community related.

We hope to be able to bring players everywhere together and to help build great memories and friendships.
